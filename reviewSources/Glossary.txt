Most often, the orbitals differ in their centers (positions), for example a pair of states localized each in one minimum of a double-well potential of a double dot. Unlike for spin-related qubits, we do not discriminate the carrier, be it electron, hole, or impurity. However, most charge-qubit experiments use electrons. This is one of the values of \key{Qubit}.
\item[\key{Coherence}] It describes in what type of experiment the corresponding coherence time has been measured. This attribute can have the following values: \val{$T_1$}, \val{$T_2^*$}, \val{$T_2^{\text{Echo}}$}, \val{$T_2^{\text{DynD}}$}, and \val{$T_2^{\text{Rabi}}$}.
\item[\key{Date}] Publication date. In tables, the year and month are given. In plots, the full date down to a day (if available) is used in sorting and horizontal shifts. If the reference is unpublished (only an arxiv version exists), we use the submission date of the first arvix version.

\item[\key{Dimensions}] The single dimension of a one-dimensional array, or the two dimensions of a two-dimensional array starting with the larger one.
\item[\key{Fidelity}] Operation fidelity. See Sec.~\ref{sec:fidelityDefinition} for details.

\item[\val{gate}] The operation is a gate. We use the following acronyms: the "C" in the two-qubit gates CZ, CPHASE, and CNOT stands for "controlled". SWAP is a two-qubit gate exchanging the two states. See \cite{mermin_quantum_2007} for more on how such gates are use in basic algorithms. Single qubit gates are often induced by ESR (electron spin resonance) or EDSR (electric dipole spin resonance). This is one of the values of \key{Operation}.

\item[\val{HY/e}] The qubit basis is represented by electron states having hybrid character, most often differing in both the spin and charge degrees of freedom. This is one of the values of \key{Qubit}.
\item[\val{imp}] The quantum dot host is an impurity. In this review we include only experiments on gated impurities accessed electrically. This is one of the values of \key{Host}.
\item[\val{initialize}] The operation is an initialization. Concerning three-qubit initializations, "GHZ" stands for Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger state. This is one of the values of \key{Operation}.
\item[\val{LD/e}] The qubit basis is represented by the spin-up and spin-down state of a confined conduction-band electron (or many-electron) state. The acronym stands for the names of Daniel Loss and David DiVincenzo, who established the field of spin qubits by their Ref.~\cite{loss_quantum_1998}. This is one of the values of \key{Qubit}.
\item[\val{LD/h}] The same as \val{LD/e} but using valence-band holes instead of conduction-band electrons. This is one of the values of \key{Qubit}.
\item[\val{LD/i}] The same as \val{LD/e} but using impurity-bound electrons instead of conduction-band electrons confined by gates \cite{kane_silicon-based_1998}. This is one of the values of \key{Qubit}.
\item[\key{Material}] Material of the device. Most of the structures used in experiments are composites, for example a heterostructure with GaAs and AlGaAs layers is given as GaAs/AlGaAs. In some plots we merge groups of materials by retaining only the primary material where the qubit host particle is located. For example, under such a contraction both "Si/SiO\textsubscript{2}" and "Si/Ge" become "Si". When merging in this way, we further merge binary and ternary alloys of Al, Ga, In, As, and Sb under the key "III-V". For carbon-based materials, we use "SLG" for single-layer graphene (usually etched), "BLG" for bi-layer graphene, and "CNT" for a carbon nanotube. When merging, carbon-based materials become "C". We use "Si:P" and "Si:B" for a phosphorus and a boron impurity in silicon \recheck{(at the moment, we have no data on other impurities)}. When merging, they become "Si:X".

\item[\val{$T_1$}] Energy relaxation. The decay of population of the energy basis state(s) was measured. Even though relaxation is physically a different process than decoherence, to simplify the database design we include the relaxation time among the coherence times. This is one of the values of \key{Coherence}.
\item[\val{$T_2^*$}] Inhomogeneous dephasing. The experiment measured the decay of phase of an idling qubit without any echos.
